# homestead

Project intended as a learning tool for myself.

At the start it is a simple farming game and I'm not sure what direction I'm taking the game in.
For now I don't have plans to ever make the game truly playable (or enjoyable), it is mostly for learning.

The idea is to do what I can with my current knowledge, and improve, rewrite and add to the code over time as I learn more.
